        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px;">JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, 
            is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript 
            is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket 
            syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

        <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide 
            Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating 
            third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine 
            to execute the code on the user's device.</p>
            
        <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
            programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, 
            dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
            
        <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, 
            storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system 
            provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
            
        <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core 
            components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.
